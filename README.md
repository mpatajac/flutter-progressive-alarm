# :alarm_clock: Progressive alarm

Flutter alarm clock app which will progressively increase sound volume over a set period of time.

## :heavy_check_mark: Implemented

- execute a function at the exact time 
- load and play a song/stream
- increase sound volume over a span of time
- refactor code into functions/methods to make further updates easier
- add enable/disable button
- add time picker (dynamically adjust alarm time)
- notify users via snackbar
- add custom app icon
- display time remaining to alarm
- MVP; simple app which will play a stream at a selected time and increase volume

<!--- Spacing -->

## :hourglass_flowing_sand: Planned

- choose how volume will increase (slow-fast, fast-slow, constant)
- choose volume increase duration
- extract alarm settings (duration, volume increase rate etc.) to separate screen
- enable user to choose a stream
- dynamic theme and main color
- enable user to adapt app settings (theme, main color)
- save user preferences and load them on app launch
- fix time remaining not updating
- enable user to preview stream ( :question_mark: )

<!--- Spacing -->

## :x: Discarded

- enable user to select which song will be played
- enable user to select which folder the songs will be picked from
- randomly choose song(s) from the selected folder
