# Progressive alarm :alarm_clock:

Flutter alarm clock app which will progressively increase sound volume over a set period of time.

## Roadmap

- 0.0.1 &rarr; execute a function at the exact time :hourglass_flowing_sand:
- 0.0.2 &rarr; load and play a song
- 0.0.3 &rarr; increase sound volume over a span of time

<!--- Spacing -->

- 0.1.0 &rarr; MVP; simple app which will play a song at a predefined, hardcoded time and increase volume
- 0.2.0 &rarr; add enable/disable button
- 0.3.0 &rarr; add time picker (dynamically adjust alarm time)
- 0.4.0 &rarr; enable user to select which song will be played
- 0.5.0 &rarr; enable user to select which folder the songs will be picked from (but play only one song)
- 0.6.0 &rarr; randomly choose song(s) from the selected folder
- 0.7.0 &rarr; play a (hardcoded) stream
- 0.8.0 &rarr; enable user to choose a stream (:question:)
